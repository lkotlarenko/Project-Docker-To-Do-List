## About this project

This project puts into practice what I studied about docker & docker-compose and is the first contact I had with docker at [Trybe](https://betrybe.com)

# Skills

* Use Docker commands in the CLI - Command Line Interface;
* Create a Docker Container for a front-end application;
* Create a Docker Container for a back-end application;
* Create a Docker Container for a test application;
* Orchestrate the three containers using the docker-compose.

---

## What should be developed

Containerize an application's frontend, backend, and tests (provided by Trybe), create a connection between them, and orchestrate their operation.

## Development

Created images of the applications and configured them with Docker-Compose.
